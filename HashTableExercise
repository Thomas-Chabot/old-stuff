- HashTable stores ints
	hash():---			[]
		 |			[]
		 |--------------------->[]
					[]
					[]

- a.equals (b) ==> a.hashCode() === b.hashCode()

HashTable
	- stores ints

c-universal
	hash (x) = hash(y) when x = y
	Pr(hash(x) = hash(y)) <= c/m when x=/=y

	Expected size of list when x not in list => cn/m  <= c
	                      when x in list     => c + 1 
Hashing with Chaining
	- Hash has to return same value for same x
	- hash(x) = hash(y) for x=y  <-- need
	- hash(x) =/= hash(y) if x=/=y <-- want
	Array a - Array of lists
	add(x):
		1) compute hash(x)
		2) push x into array at position hash(x)
	find (x):
		1) compute hash (x)
		2) find the array at position hash (x)
		3) walk through, check if each element === x

Multiplicative Hashing
	r is an odd random w-bit integer
	((x * r) mod 2^w) div 2^(w-d)
		in java: x * r >>> (w-d)
			right shift in js?
Hash codes
	high bits ^ low bits
		(xor)
	Multiplicative
	Random? May be able to show this?
	Other hash codes ...?


EXERCISE:
	- Pick a random hashCode function. This will generate hash codes.
	- Create a HashTable and for every value, insert the value into the Table using its Hash Code.
	- Show the operations of add, remove, and find on the hash table.

	Generator
		.hashCode
		.HashTable
	HashTable > Structure
		Implementation of a HashTable
		Can access the properties of the table:
			- list[position]
			- Go through each list[position] to display it
	Build
		Show the main HashSet => Would be an array of lists
		When given a HashCode, click that position in the HashSet (jump to it?)
		Show the array, one element at a time, walk through the array (scrolling? keyboard keys?)
	Event Handler
		- Keyboard keys? Could have left, right
		- Mouse =>
			ScrollLeft
			ScrollRight
			Click
	Answer
		Compute what the actual answer should be for an operation
		Check if the given answer matches the actual answer
		If working with Random hashCode:
			Say "this is correct, but the element is in the list!" .... or something.

	ElementArray
	BaseArray
	JsPlumb? Could have lines from each element pointing to their lists
	Pointers? ^^^
